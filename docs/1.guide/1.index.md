# Getting started

srvx provides a unified standard API to create HTTP servers based on the standard web platform primitives ([fetch][fetch], [Request][Request] and [Response][Response]) and works seamlessly with [Deno](Deno), [Bun](Bun) and [Node.js](Node.js).

:read-more{to="/guide/why" title="Why srvx"}

For [Deno](Deno) and [Bun](Bun) srvx unifies interface with zero overhead and for [Node.js][Node.js], creates a lightweight compatibility layer to wrap [node:IncomingMessage](IncomingMessage) as a standard [Request](Request) object and convert final state of [node:ServerResponse](ServerResponse) to a standard [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object.

## How is it different from other http frameworks?

You might ask, what is the difference between srvx and other http frameworks such as [h3](https://h3.unjs.io/), [nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/) and [express](https://expressjs.com/).

Srvx, adds a simple, low-level and universal API very similar to [Deno][Deno] and [Bun][Bun]. It has **no conventions**, utils or router and in most of the cases using servx has **zero-overhead**.

We plan to adopt srvx as the runtime-agnostic server API across UnJS and beyond ([h3](https://h3.unjs.io/), [nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/), [listhen](https://listhen.unjs.io/)), so if you are using one of these today, you will soon already leverage srvx without even needing to read this docs!

The idea of srvx had been extracted from [h3](https://h3.unjs.io/) v2 development branch and opened to a wider ecosystem in order to help adoption of Web platform standards without enforcing conventions of our choices.

## Quick start

A server can be started using `serve` function from `srvx` package.

```js
import { serve } from "srvx";

const server = serve({
  fetch(request) {
    return new Response("ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!");
  },
});

await server.ready();

console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${server.url}`);
```
